# Corona-virus-propagation


## Description
This project explores different models for SARS-CoV-2 propagation with  **Python** and **R**.
The main objective is the estimation of real number of cases and prediction of new cases. 
Data from different countries will be used and updated as they become available. The variables of interest are confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries and location.

## Files 
To run, the code requires the following files which are included:
*  covid_19_data.csv      : time series data with 8 observations and  8 variables.
